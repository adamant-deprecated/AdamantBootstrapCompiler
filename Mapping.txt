This document describes the mapping from Adamant to C#.  Names beginning with "א" are reserved for the mapping

* The namespace "אRuntime" contains classes for use by the compiler for mapping.
* All Adamant namespaces are placed in the namespace "א" to avoid name collision and accidental reference to .NET types
* "void" is mapped to the struct "אVoid" (in אRuntime) to enable it to be used as a true types
* Function declaration are placed in "אFuncs" classes since they are not directly supported by C#
* "אAssemblyInfo.cs" is used for emitting the assembly info (version etc)
* "אEntryPoint.cs" and the "אEntryPoint" are used to declare the C# Main method
* Since C# constructors aren't as flexible as Adamant constructors, constructors are called through static methods. This involves:
	1. Creating a non-generic version of the classes
	2. Static methods named "אCtor" on that classes that call the actual constructors
	3. Named constructors are placed on nested classes
	4. All classes must be mapped as partial to avoid issues with the above class duplicating their name
	5. The actual constructors are declared on the class
	6. For named constructors, actual constructors are declared with a first parameter of "אCtorName_XXX אctorName" to disambiguate calls.
	7. "אCtorName_XXX" types in the root namespace to avoid ambiguity (these are internal to the assembly)
